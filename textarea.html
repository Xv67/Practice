<! An <input> element with type="text" creates a single row input field for users to type in information. However, there are cases where users need to write in more information, like a blog post. In such cases, instead of using an <input>, we could use <textarea>.-->
<!--The <textarea> element is used to create a bigger text field for users to write more text. We can add the attributes rows and cols to determine the amount of rows and columns for the <textarea>.-->
<!--When we submit the form, the value of <textarea> is the text written inside the box. If we want to add a default value to text to <textarea> we would include it within the opening and closing tags -->
<form>
  <label for="blog">New Blog Post: </label>
  <br>
  <textarea id="blog" name="blog" rows="5" cols="30">
  </textarea>
</form>
